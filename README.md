## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies to run locally, run the following command:
- npm i
- npm start

## Development Notes
- I have the application start at the Home route because I'm eventually going to be adding a Home component to display a blog post.
- Additionally, this app was deployed on Netlify as it has a much better interface than Github pages for React deployments.

## Usage
This application is used to display my portfolio.
